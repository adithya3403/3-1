              REGRESSION
------------------------------------------------------------------

Meaning of Regression:
    Regression is the relationship between one dependent variable and a series of independent variables.
    It helps to determine if independent variable does a good job in predicting the dependent variable.
    Which independent variable plays a significant role in predicting the dependent variable.
    The dictionary meaning of Regression is : "stepping back or going back"
    Examples of Regression:
        1. Prediction of rain using temperature and other factors
        2. Determining market trends 
        3. House Price Prediction
        4. Flight price prediction
        5. Prediction of road accidents due to rash driving
    
Regression Analysis:
    Regression Analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent variable and 
    one or more independent variables. 
    Example for Regression Analysis:
        Suppose there is a marketing company A who does various advertisements every year and gets sales on that.
            advertisements     sales 
            $ 90              $ 1000 
            $ 120             $ 1300
            $ 150             $ 1800
            $ 100             $ 1200
            $ 130             $ 1380
            $ 200                ?
        Now the company wants to do the advertisement of $200 in the year 2022 and wants to know the 
        prediction about sales for this year. To solve such type of prediction in machine learning, we need 
        to use regression analysis. Thus, regression is considered as an explanation for causation.
