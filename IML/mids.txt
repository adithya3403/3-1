ML applications:
    image recognition, traffic prediction, email spam filtering,
    stock market trading, language translation, object detection, etc.

Supervised categories: PREDICT OUTCOME/FUTURE
    Computer is taught by example. It is given a set of inputs and
    the desired outputs, and it learns to map the inputs to the outputs.
    Ex: text categorisation, predicting house price, stock price
    prediction, face detection, weather forecasting, etc.
    Two types:
        Classification: (Discrete)
            can be categorized such as yes/no, pass/fail
            spam detection, scorecard prediction of exams, etc.
        Regression: (Continuous)
            is output real value such as salary, weigth, pressure...

Unsupervised categories: FIND HIDDEN STRUCTURE IN DATA
    Computer is given a set of inputs and it tries to find some
    structure in the data.
    Ex: fraud detection, identification of errors during entry,
    market based analysis, ...
    Two types:
        Clustering:
            group similar data points together called clusters
            it finds a similarity among data points
        Association:
            identify rare items which differ from majority of data
            Ex: bank fraud, medical error, etc.

Reinforcement Learning: LEARN SERIES OF ACTIONS
    Learning policy: A sequence of outputs
    Learning goal: A reward function
    Learning method: Trial and error
    Ex: robot in a maze, playing a game, self-driving cars, etc.

Batch Learning:
    Trained using all the available data
    It will take a lot of time and resources, so is done offline
    also called as offline Learning
    Ex: training a model to predict house prices

Online Learning:
    Train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances
    It is good for systems that receive data as a continuous flow
    training happens by feeding data in small groups
    each step is fast and cheap, so can be done online
    Ex: stock prices, predictions...

ML challenges:
    Insufficient quantity of training data
    Poor-quality data
    Irrelevant features
    Overfitting the training data
    Underfitting the training data

Types of Data:
    Qualitative:
        counted in form of numbers, eg: gender, fav color, fav place, ...
            Nominal: labels for existing data(hair color, gender, nationality)
            Ordinal: rankings(reviews on scale 1-5, grades in exams: A, B, C)
    Quantitative: 
        includes statistical data analysis or numeric data, eg: height, temperature
            Discrete: number of students in a class, days in a week, ...
            Continuous: height of a person, spee dof vehicle, ...

Descriptive Statistics: summarize data through numbers
    Central Tendency: one number summary of a set of data
        Mean: average of all the values(arithmetic average)
        Median: middle value of the data(positional average)
        Mode: most frequent value of the data
    Dispersion / Data variability: how spread out the data is
        Range: max-min in a dataset
        Variance: how far each number is from the mean
            high variance: spread out, low variance: points are very close
        Standard Deviation: square root of the variance
            low stddev: clustered around mean, high stddev: spread out
        Inter Quartile Range: IQR=Q3-Q1
            Q1: 25th percentile, Q2: median, Q3: 75th percentile, IQR=Q3-Q1
        Mean abs Dev: avg distance between each point and mean of the data

Box-Plot:
    type of graph that help visualize the five-number summary
    it shows the min, max, median(Q2), Q1 and Q3
    the whiskers are the two lines outside the box
    maximum=Q3+1.5*IQR, minimum=Q1-1.5*IQR
    Outlier:
        data points that are far from the rest of the data

Covariance: direction of linear relationship bw two variables
    lies between -infinity and +infinity

Correlation: strength of linear relationship bw two continuous variables
    lies between -1 and +1
    +1: perfect positive correlation
    -1: perfect negative correlation
    0: no correlation

Causation: changes in one variable brings about changes in another variable
    the two variables are correlated with each other

Data Preprocessing: technique used to transform raw to efficient data
    Data Cleaning: removing missing values, outliers, etc.
    Data Integration: combining data from multiple sources
    Data Transformation: scaling, normalization, etc.
    Data Reduction: dimensionality reduction, feature selection, etc.

Data visualization: graphical representation of data
    Bar graph: graphs that can be used to compare data
    Histogram: graphs that is continuous type of chart
    Scatter plot: uses dots to represent values for two different variables
    Pie chart: divides into slices to show proportions
