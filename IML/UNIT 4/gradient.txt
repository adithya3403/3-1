```GRADIENT```

A gradient measures how much the output of a function changes if you change the inputs a little bit.
In math terms, a graident is a partial derivative with respect to its inputs.
In ML, a gradient is a derivative of a fucntion that has more than ine input variable.
The gradient simply measures the change in all weights with regard to the change in error.
