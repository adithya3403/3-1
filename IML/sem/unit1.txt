UNIT 1:
    What is Machine Learning:
        science of programming computers so they can learn from data
        field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
        definition of ML:
            computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and performance measure P
            if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E
    Uses of Machine Learning:
        learning is any process by which a system improves performance from experience
        learning is used when:
            human experts are not available, eg: navigating on mars
            solution changes in time, eg:routing on computer network
            solution needs to be adapted to cases, eg:biometrics
    Types of Machine Learning Systems: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, Reinforcement Learning
        supervised learning:
            algorithms are presented with instances from which they learn a way to classify
            fully labeled data -> Machine -> ML model + test data -> predictions (labels)
            two types:
                classification: categorical target variable(credit scoring)
                    for eg: animals -> alg -> model+(lion pic) -> output=lion
                regression: continuous target variable(housing price)
                    statistical procedure that determines the equation for straight line that best fits the data
                    any line can be represented by equation y=bx+a, where b=slope, a=y_intercept
        unsupervised learning: no output
            learning what normally happens
            clustering: grouping similar instances
            fully unlabelled data -> machine -> results(clusters)
            eg: animals -> alg -> groups of animals
            example applications: customer segmentation, image compression, bioinformatics
            two types: target variable not available
                clustering: customer segmentation
                association: market based analysis
        semi-supervised: categorical target variable
            small labeled -> ML model + large unlabeled -> pseudo-labeled -> ML model trained
            two types:
                classification: text classification
                clustering: lane finding on gps data
        Reinforcement Learning:
            it is a learning policy: sequence of outputs
            no supervised output but delayed reward
            eg: credit assignment problem, game playing, robot in a maze
            two types:
                classification: categorical target variable(optimized marketing)
                control: target variable not available(driverless car)
              --------------->----------------
              |  ------------>-------------  |
              |  |        action a         | |
            agent                     environment
              |  |        reward rt        | |
              |  -------------<------------  |
              ----------------<---------------
                          state st
            eg: dog(sitting) ---state(action)--> dog(walks), so rewards biscuits
    Differences among them:
            supervised:     labeled data        direct feedback     predict outcome
            unsupervised:   no labels           no feedback         find hidden structure
            reinforcement:  decision process    reward system       learn series of action
    Batch and Online Learning:
        ML system -> incremental learning -> batch and online learning(two types)
        batch learning:
            learning over groups of patterns, most algorithms are batch
            system is incapable of learning incrementally, all data is send at once ONLY
            must be trained using all the available data, takes lot of time so done offline
            it represents training of model at regular intervals like weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.
            if u want to change/improve, start all over again
            also called as offline learning
        online learning:
            learning based on each pattern as it is observed
            train the system incrementally by feeding data sequentially, either individually or small groups
            great for systems that receive daa as continuous flow(eg: stock prices)
            used where need to adapt to changing data quickly
            training happens in an incremental manner by feeding as it arrives or in groups/batches
            each step is fast and cheap, so done online
    Main Challenges of Machine Learning:
        not enough training data, irrelevant features, overfitting, underfitting, non-representative training data
