UNIT2:
    types of data:
        qualitative: language, colors, opinions
            nominal: hair color, gender, nationality, eye color
            ordinal: economic status(high medium low), ranking(1st 2nd 3rd), feedback(1-10)
        quantitative: height, weight, time, marks
            discrete: total number of students, days in a week, cost of phone
