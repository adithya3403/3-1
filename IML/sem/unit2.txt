UNIT 2:
    types of data:
        qualitative:
            categorical data that cant be measured or counted in numbers
            sorted by category, not by number
            eg: gender(male, female, others) is qualitative
            other eg: language we speak, colors, opinion(agree, disagree, neutral)
            two types:
                nominal: labels for existing data, eg: hair color, gender, nationality
                ordinal: ranking data, eg: grades in exams, ranking 1st 2nd 3rd in exams
        quantitative: also known as numeric data
            can be expressed in numerical values, countable and statistical data analysis
            can be represented on graphs and charts such as bar graphs, histograms
            eg: height/weight, room temperature, scores/marks, time
            two types:
                discrete: countable data, eg: number of students, days in a week, cost of phone
                continuous: data in fractional values, eg: height, weight, time, temperature
        interval data: measurable and countable data, eg: temperature, time, age
        ratio data: measurable, countable and has a true zero, eg: height, weight, age
    central tendency:
        descriptive statistics:
            summarize the data through numbers like mean, median, mode, etc.
            they represent the available data in a single number
            measures of central tendency:
                mean: arithmetic mean of dataset, mean=sum(x)/N, where N=no. of observations
                median: middle number in sorted dataset
                    if n is odd, median=(n+1/2)th obs
                    if n is even, median=((n/2)th obs + (n/2+1)th obs)/2
                mode: value that occurs most often, highest frequency
            measures of dispersion:
                range: amount bw smallest and largest items in the set
                variance: sigma^2=sum((xi-xmean)^2)/N-1 for sample, N for population
                    it gives users idea of how spread the data is
                    high variance means very spread out from mean
                    low means very close to mean
                standard deviation: sigma=SD=sqrt(variance)=sqrt(sum((xi-xmean)^2)/N-1)
                    tells how tightly their data is clustered around mean
                    low SD means clustered around mean, high means spread out
                mean absolute deviation: MAD=sum(|xi-mean|)/N
                    avg distance bw each point and mean of data
    finding the percentile:
    inter quartile range(IQR): indicates variability, IQR=Q3-Q1
        divides dataset into quartiles(4 parts)
        first quartile, Q1: median of lower half of data/25th percentile
        second quartile, Q2: median of entire dataset/50th percentile
        third quartile, Q3: median of upper half of data/75th percentile
    Box Plot: type of graph that help visualize five number summary
        five number summary=(min, Q1, median, Q3, max)
        ideal for comparing distributions of data
        Q1=lower quartile, Q3=upper quartile, IQR=Q3-Q1
    Outlier: data points that are far away from other data points
        can be caused by measurement error, data entry error, or rare events
        can be removed or replaced with median
        anything above Q3+1.5*IQR or below Q1-1.5*IQR is an outlier
    calculating:
        covariance: cov(x, y)=sum((x-xmean)*(y-ymean))/N
            signifies direction of linear relationship bw teo variables
            it means either directly proportional or inversely proportional
            if cov(x, y)<0 then x and y are inversely proportional
            if cov(x, y)>0 then x and y are directly proportional
            if cov(x, y)=0 then x and y are not related
        correlation: lies bw -1 and 1
            used to study strength of relationship bw two continuous variables
            corr= cov(x, y)/(SD(x)*SD(y)), this is called correlation coefficient
            three types:
                positive: increase in A -> increase in B or vice-versa
                negative: increase in A -> decrease in B or vice-versa
                no correlation: unrelated and doesn't change others
        causation:
            changes in one variable brings changes in other variable
            there is a cause-and-effect relationship
            eg: laptop runs out of battery --causation--> [shuts down <---correlation--> video player stops]
    Data preprocessing:
        technique used to transform raw data in useful and efficient format, stpes:
            data cleaning:
                missing data: ignore tuples, fill missing values manually/computer
                noisy data: binning, regression, clustering
            data transformation:
                normalization: scale the data values in range(-1 to 1 or 0 to 1)
                attribute selection: new attributes are constructed from given set
                discretization: replace the raw values by interval/conceptual levels
                concept hierarchy generation: converted from lower to higher levels, eg:city->country
            data reduction:
                size of data can be too large to handle
                one sol is to reduce the size of data but still retain the important info
                data cube aggregation: summarize data by grouping into categories
                numerosity reduction: represent as model/equation like regression model
                attribute subset selection: only attributes which add high value must be considered
                dimensionality reduction: reduce number of redundant features in ML algos
    Data visualization: graphical representation
        bar graph:
            used to show something that changes over time and to compare items
            plt.bar([1,2,3,4,5],[45,50,55,60,65])
        histogram:
            graphic display of data using bars
            this is continuous type of chart
            x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12], num_bins=4
            plt.hist(x, num_bins)
        scatter plot:
            uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables
            used to observer relationships bw variables
            x=[1,2,3,4,5,6], y=[5,10,15,20,23,30]
            plt.scatter(x,y)
        pie chart:
            circular statistical graphic, divided into slices to show numerical proportion
            arc length of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents
            st=[1,2,3,4,5], labels=['a','b','c','d','e']
            plt.pie(st, labels=labels)
